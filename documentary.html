<h1 h1 style="text-align:center;" >DOCUMENTARY MOVIES</h3>
<p>Documentaries bring viewers into new worlds and experiences through the presentation of factual information about real people, places, and events, generally -- but not always -- portrayed through the use of actual images and artifacts. But factuality alone does not define documentary films; it's what the filmmaker does with those factual elements, weaving them into an overall narrative that strives to be as compelling as it is truthful and is often greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

    <td><p>In the fall of 1997, Michael Jordan and the Chicago 
      Bulls allowed a film crew to follow them as they went 
      for their sixth NBA title in eight seasons. That 
      resulted in a stunning portrait of one of the sport's
       most iconic athletes and a celebrated team. "The Last
        Dance" follows the Bulls' 1997-98 season from start 
        to finish, while also covering the rest of the 
        chapters in Jordan's remarkable career. The 10-part 
        docuseries follows the Jordan timeline from when
         he was an emerging star on his high school team 
         to becoming a worldwide marketing force and 
         cultural figure. The series takes its name 
         from a phrase coined by then-Bulls coach Phil 
         Jackson, who knew that the season would likely 
         be the final run for the core members of that 
         1990s Bulls dynasty.</p></td>
