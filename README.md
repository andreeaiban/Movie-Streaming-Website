Write a white paper outlining the following concepts and answer the following questions:
what is your business 
what is the business ethos,
what do you produce/make/offer/sell,
who is your target audience
what are the key motivations of why you expect people to visit your website and how you will attract and motivate people therein,
do they want general information / research (such as background on a topic / company), or are they after something specific (such as a particular fact or information on a product)?
are they already familiar with the service or product that you offer or do they need to be introduced to it?
are they looking for time sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular topic?
do they want to discover information about a specific product or service to help them decide whether to buy it or not?
do they need to contact you? If so, can they visit in person (which might require opening hours and a map)? Or might they need email or telephone contact details 
will visitors be familiar with your subject area / brand or do you need to introduce yourself?
will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it? 
what are the most important features of what you are offering?
what is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?
once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area
Your white paper should explain how you implemented concepts in visual hierarchy, grouping, and similarity in your design
Your white paper should take another website (that already exists on the web) and analyze it based on the above, creating a wireframe for it as well.
Your website should have at least three pages (all hosted locally, that can be accessed from one another).  You must create a wireframe for each page
You must create a gray paper that explains the HTML, CSS, and JS that you did. It should outline at least 30 different points, showing the code and explaining what it does.
Your HTML must include a minimum of one table, links, two lists, five images, a navigation bar, three forms (text box, radio button, checkbox, submit, and button), and anything else you like.
Your CSS must be extensive and consistent with your business model and design.
You must implement the ideas in at least four out of the first 10 examples in the udemy course.
All your group names should appear on the website.
You should have one HTML, CSS, and JS file for each page of your website (so altogether there will be nine files).  You should upload the files to github and submit a link.  On Blackboard, you should be uploading the following:
your white paper
your gray paper
your wireframes
a screenshot of each of your websites (uploaded as a PDF)
a link to your github where each of the HTML, CSS, and JS files are
a video of you showing your website in action, and explaining the highlights of your code. You should mention two or three issues that you had trouble with and how you figured them out.
You may work in groups of up to five people.
